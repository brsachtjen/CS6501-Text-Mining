title: Paper Presentation
---

The purpose of this paper presentation is to help students to practice giving talks in front of public at research conferences or other situations.

After each lecture, there will be three to ten recommended readings. Everyone is asked to select one paper from the list, and prepare a 15-minutes presentation for the class. One paper can only be presented by one student. Students are required to prepare the slides by themselves (the original authors' slides are not allowed to be used for this presentation).

It is preferred that the students could present the paper on the day when the topic is covered in the lecture, such that the audiences can get different flavors of the topic. The student presentation will be placed at the end of the class (unless the student requires to present at the beginning of the class).

Giving an impressive presentation is an art. Some helpful tips can be found in the [resource page]({{site.baseurl}}/resources).

Both the instructor and other students will grade the presentation (**no self-grading**). The detailed grading criteria are as follows.

Paper presentation sign up is due in the end of **6th week** of the semester. The paper presentation will start on the **7th week**.
