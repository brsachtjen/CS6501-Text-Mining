title: Midterm Exam
---

The course midterm will be late in the semester (after we have covered most of the lecture content), in a regular class period of 90 minutes. There is no final exam. There will be **no** aids for the exam, such as a laptop/tablet/mobilephone or cheat sheet.

Exam questions include True/False question, short answer questions, and short essay questions. 

A review lecture will be given prior to the exam, practice midterm questions will be provided one week before the exam.
